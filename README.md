# VS-PHP-AngularJS
VS-PHP-AngularJS is a lightweight PHP + AngularJS project put together in VSC2017 to avoid chaos such as Node.js, Webpack, Gulp, etc, by simply using Mads Kristensens BundlerMinifier extension. 

Though this project lack account/session/roles handling, as it stands, it is mostly intended to serve as evidence that I have at least some experience with PHP. I have other PHP projects, but they cannot be made public. As I've moved on to C# / .NET Core, I will not be updating this project any further unless I have to.
